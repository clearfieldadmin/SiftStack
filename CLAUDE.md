# CLAUDE.md — SiftStack

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**SiftStack** — Full-stack real estate investing operations platform built around DataSift.ai CRM. Covers the entire REI business lifecycle:

1. **Data Acquisition:** Web scraping tnpublicnotice.com (foreclosures, tax sales, probates), scanned PDF import, courthouse terminal photo import (probate, eviction, code violations, divorce), Dropbox auto-polling
2. **Enrichment Pipeline:** 10+ steps — Smarty address standardization, Zillow property data, Knox County Tax API, obituary/heir research, Ancestry.com SSDI, Tracerfy skip trace, Trestle phone scoring, entity research
3. **Deal Analysis:** Comparable sales (Two-Bucket ARV), rehab estimation (4-tier room-by-room), deal analyzer (MAO/ROI/financing scenarios)
4. **Market Intelligence:** Zip code scoring, Market Finder reports, cash buyer list building, investor portfolio analysis
5. **CRM Automation:** DataSift upload, 26 TCA sequence templates, 12 niche sequential marketing presets, filter preset management, SiftMap sold property tagging
6. **Lead Management:** 4 Pillars of Motivation auto-qualification, STABM daily routine, pipeline reporting, deep prospecting (4-level framework)
7. **Operations:** Acquisition playbook generator (SOPs, scripts, checklists), Slack/Discord notifications, Google Drive upload, Apify Actor deployment

Currently focused on Knox and Blount counties, Tennessee.

8. **REI Skill Library:** 19 Claude Co-Work skill files (`.skill`/`.plugin` ZIPs) for distribution to DataSift community via [learn.datasift.ai/claude-skills-rei](https://learn.datasift.ai/claude-skills-rei). Skills teach Claude specific REI workflows when uploaded to Co-Work sessions or Projects.

## Architecture

**Data flows:**
- **Web scrape:** `main.py` → `scraper.py` → `captcha_solver.py` → `notice_parser.py` + `foreclosure_filter.py` → enrichment → CSV
- **PDF import:** `main.py` → `pdf_importer.py` (pypdfium2 → `image_utils.py` OCR) → enrichment → CSV
- **Photo import:** `main.py` → `photo_importer.py` (OpenCV → `image_utils.py` OCR → `llm_parser.py`) → enrichment → CSV
- **Dropbox watch:** `dropbox_watcher.py` → `photo_importer.py` → enrichment → CSV (auto-polling loop)
- **Market Finder:** `extract_market_finder.py` → DataSift Market Finder (Playwright) → paginate all ZIP + neighborhood data → JSON → `generate_knox_report.py` → 7-sheet Excel

- **main.py** — CLI entry point. Parses args (`daily`/`historical`, `--split`, `--counties`, `--types`, `-v`). Filters saved searches by county/type, orchestrates scrape → dedup → export, logs run summary stats.
- **scraper.py** — Playwright browser automation. Reuses saved session cookies when possible, falls back to fresh login. Selects each saved search from the Smart Search dropdown (triggers ASP.NET postback), paginates results (50/page max), clicks each View button to open notice detail pages. Uses `last_run.json` for daily mode state, `cookies.json` for session persistence.
- **captcha_solver.py** — Solves reCAPTCHA v2 via **2Captcha API** on every notice detail page. Sends websiteURL + sitekey, gets back a `g-recaptcha-response` token, injects it, clicks "View Notice". Retries up to 3 times. This is the primary bottleneck (~10-30s per notice).
- **notice_parser.py** — Extracts structured fields from raw notice text using regex. There are NO structured HTML fields on the site — address, owner, dates are all embedded in free-text notice bodies. Defines the `NoticeData` dataclass used throughout.
- **foreclosure_filter.py** — Filters foreclosure search results to only keep real first-to-market trustee sales. Matches against observed title variations (substitute/successor trustee sales). Non-foreclosure notice types pass through unfiltered.
- **data_formatter.py** — Deduplicates by address (keeps most recent), then converts `NoticeData` list to Sift upload CSV. Split mode produces `{county}_{type}_{timestamp}.csv` files.
- **config.py** — Credentials (from `.env`), ASP.NET element selectors, saved search definitions, rate limiting constants, paths, image processing thresholds.
- **image_utils.py** — Shared OCR utilities used by both `pdf_importer.py` and `photo_importer.py`. Exports `fix_rotation()` (Tesseract OSD) and `ocr_page(image, psm)` with configurable page segmentation mode. Handles Tesseract binary detection.
- **photo_importer.py** — Courthouse phone photo import. OpenCV preprocessing chain (EXIF transpose → blur check → bilateral filter → perspective correction → Otsu threshold) → Tesseract OCR (PSM 4) → LLM parsing → NoticeData. Supports all 7 notice types.
- **dropbox_watcher.py** — Cursor-based Dropbox folder polling. Downloads new photos, resolves county + notice_type from folder path (`/Knox/eviction/photo.jpg`), processes through photo_importer, deletes from Dropbox after success. State persisted to `dropbox_state.json` + `photo_state.json`.
- **report_generator.py** — Generates per-record PDF deep prospecting reports using reportlab. Includes property summary, signing chain with phone tiers, valuation, deceased owner detection. Output to `output/reports/`.
- **extract_market_finder.py** — Playwright automation to extract ALL ZIP code + neighborhood data from DataSift Market Finder. Handles styled-component dropdowns, pagination (20 rows/page), Beamer popup dismissal. Outputs JSON. See "Market Finder Extraction Patterns" below.
- **market_analyzer.py** — ZIP code scoring engine. 6-factor weighted composite (Distress 30%, Value 20%, Equity 15%, Tax Delinquency 15%, Competition 10%, DOM 10%). Grades A/B/C/D, budget allocation across top ZIPs. Reads from scraped notice CSVs in `output/`.
- **drive_uploader.py** — Google Drive upload via service account. `upload_file()` (generic, returns webViewLink) and `upload_csv()` (CSV-specific, returns file ID).

## Site-Specific Details

The site is **ASP.NET WebForms** — all navigation uses `__doPostBack()` with ViewState. Session IDs are embedded in URL paths (`/(S({guid}))/`). Playwright is required because direct HTTP requests would need to manage ViewState/EventValidation manually.

**reCAPTCHA v2 is required on every single notice detail page**, even when logged in. There is no CAPTCHA on login, search, or results pages. The sitekey is hardcoded in `config.py`.

## Saved Searches

8 searches defined in `config.py` as `SAVED_SEARCHES`. Each maps to an exact dropdown option name on the Smart Search dashboard:
- Knox & Blount × (Foreclosure V2, Tax Sale V2, Tax Delinquent V2, Probate V2)

Filterable via `--counties` and `--types` CLI args (comma-separated, or omit for all).

## Key Domain Rules

- **Foreclosure filtering is critical.** Not all notices from "Foreclosure" saved searches are actual foreclosures. The scraper parses each notice's full text and only includes ones with trustee sale language. See `INCLUDE_PHRASES` / `EXCLUDE_PHRASES` in `foreclosure_filter.py`.
- **Probate owner_name** should be the Personal Representative/Executor/Administrator — not the deceased.
- **Owner names** in foreclosure notices typically appear after "executed by" in the deed of trust language.
- **Rate limiting:** 2-3 second random delays between requests, 3 retries per page.
- **Address dedup:** Same property can appear in multiple notices; `data_formatter.deduplicate()` keeps the most recent.

## Output

CSV files land in `output/` (gitignored). Logs go to `logs/` with timestamped filenames. Sift columns: `date_added, address, city, state, zip, owner_name, notice_type, county, source_url`.

**Date Semantics (build 1.0.30+):** `date_added` = the date WE added the record (the pipeline run date, stamped in `run_enrichment_pipeline`), so a daily run shows today. The legal notice's publication date lives in its own field/column, `date_published` / "Notice Publish Date" (parsed by `notice_parser` / the scraper results grid). PDF/photo imports set `date_added` explicitly (preserved, not re-stamped); CSV re-import preserves both columns. Downstream that needs the filing date (DOD sanity check, DataSift Probate Open Date, the month tag, dedup tie-break) uses `date_published` (fallback `date_added`).

## Notice Screenshots (proof-of-source)

Each scraped notice gets a full-page screenshot of its detail page on tnpublicnotice.com, captured the moment the reCAPTCHA is solved and the legal notice is visible (`notice_screenshot.py::capture_notice_screenshot`, called from `scraper.py` in the kept-notice branch). The image is the actual published notice, used to add legitimacy to outreach.

- **Scope:** foreclosures only by default (`config.NOTICE_SCREENSHOT_TYPES`, comma-separated env override). Toggle the whole feature with `CAPTURE_NOTICE_SCREENSHOTS` (default on). Capture is best-effort: a screenshot failure never drops the record. PNGs land in `output/notices/` (gitignored), named `notice_{ID}.png` by the numeric notice ID.
- **Carried on `NoticeData`:** `notice_screenshot_path` (local PNG, set at scrape) → `notice_screenshot_url` (hosted link, set at output time).
- **Hosting:** Apify run pushes each PNG to the key-value store and sets a shareable URL (mirrors the deep-prospecting PDF pattern). CLI run uploads to Google Drive when `GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID` + `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` are set, else falls back to the local path. Helpers: `host_screenshots_via_drive()`, `set_local_screenshot_urls()`.
- **Delivery to DataSift:** the URL rides along as the `Notice Screenshot` custom field plus a "Notice Screenshot:" line in record Notes (`datasift_formatter`). DataSift's CSV upload cannot push an image into the REISift Gallery panel, so the link is the supported route.

## Scraping Backend: Scrapfly (build 1.0.31+)

The gated notice detail fetch (the "caps structure": residential proxy, anti-bot, reCAPTCHA, and the proof-of-source screenshot) can run through the **Scrapfly API** instead of the in-house Playwright + 2Captcha path. Selected by `SCRAPE_BACKEND` (defaults to `scrapfly` when `SCRAPFLY_KEY` is set, otherwise `playwright`).

- **`scrapfly_client.py`** provides `ScrapflyNoticeClient`. `login(session)` logs into Smart Search inside a Scrapfly session (forms-auth cookie + sticky residential IP), then `fetch_notice(id, session)` opens the detail page with `asp=True` + `render_js=True`, a JS scenario clicks "View Notice" (ASP solves the reCAPTCHA), and it returns rendered HTML + a full-page screenshot in one call. `fetch_notices(ids)` logs in once and yields a result per ID. Best-effort with retries; every call returns a `NoticeFetchResult`.
- **Scraper integration** (`scraper.py`): when `SCRAPE_BACKEND == "scrapfly"`, Playwright still drives login + saved-search navigation and supplies each notice ID, but the per-notice content + screenshot come from Scrapfly via `_scrapfly_notice()`. Any Scrapfly failure falls back to the 2Captcha path, so the swap is safe. Returned HTML is parsed by `notice_parser.parse_notice_html()` (shares field extraction with `parse_notice_page`).
- **Screenshots** come natively from Scrapfly (`screenshots={'notice': 'fullpage'}`), saved to `output/notices/` and hosted/linked exactly like the Playwright path.
- **Tooling:** `scrapfly_spike.py --id <id>` validates one notice (gate clears + screenshot) before relying on it. `backfill_screenshots.py [--csv ...]` logs in once and backfills screenshots for a master list (e.g. the output of `consolidate_foreclosures.py`), writing `notice_screenshot_path` / `notice_screenshot_url` back to the CSV.
- **Env:** `SCRAPFLY_KEY` (required), `SCRAPE_BACKEND`, `SCRAPFLY_COUNTRY` (default `us`), `SCRAPFLY_RENDER_WAIT_MS`, `SCRAPFLY_TIMEOUT_MS`, `SCRAPFLY_MAX_RETRIES`. Needs `scrapfly-sdk` (in requirements.txt).
- **Open validation:** whether Scrapfly's ASP clears this site's in-page reCAPTCHA "View Notice" gate is confirmed per-notice by the spike. A `gate_not_cleared` result means the JS scenario action schema or an explicit CAPTCHA step needs a tweak.

## Foreclosure Master List Consolidation (build 1.0.31+)

`consolidate_foreclosures.py` builds a master list of still-active foreclosures from the last N months of runs. It pulls each Apify run's `output.csv` from the run's key-value store (the default dataset is unused), merges local `output/` CSVs, dedupes by **property** (address + city, keeping the latest sale date so republished/postponed notices collapse to one), and removes any whose `auction_date` ("option date") has already passed. Needs `APIFY_TOKEN`. Output: `output/foreclosure_master_active_<date>.csv`.

```bash
python src/consolidate_foreclosures.py --months 3                  # Apify + local
python src/consolidate_foreclosures.py --months 3 --require-sale-date  # drop no-date junk
python src/consolidate_foreclosures.py --county Knox --no-apify     # local only, one county
```

## Comp Package Engine (build 1.0.33, 2026-07)

One-command, boundary-filtered comp package for a subject property (the "158 Old State Rd" deliverable, generalized). Pipeline: subject facts -> API sold/active pull -> boundary clip -> condition bucketing -> dual-track ARV -> rehab scenarios -> MAO math -> buyer matching -> branded Excel workbook.

- **`src/zillow_market_api.py`** — reusable OpenWeb Ninja `/search` client. THE API CONTRACT MOVED: `similar-sale-homes` (and every other comps-style endpoint) is retired and 404s; `/search` is the workhorse. Hard-won contract (verified 2026-07-21): `home_status` must be exactly `RECENTLY_SOLD`/`FOR_SALE` (else 400); every search caps at 41 rows with `totalPages=1` (~5 weeks of sales in an active zip), so `pull_sold()` partitions by `min_price`/`max_price` bands and recursively splits saturated bands (recovers 2-3 years per zip, ~50-80 calls); `price_min`/`price_max` are SILENTLY ignored — always check the echoed `parameters` object to confirm a filter applied; `dateSold` is epoch ms; `soldPrice` is a display string (use `unformattedPrice`); `homeType: LOT` can be a house sold at land value or a new build with missing sqft (verify against the county card). MLS-only: auction/wholesale/off-market transfers never appear — county records are truth for those.
- **`src/comp_package.py`** — CLI orchestrator (see Commands). Boundary = bbox AND street-regex (apply both: bbox catches street misses, streets catch bleed across I-40/highway edges). Condition bucketing by sold-price/Zestimate ratio (>=0.90 renovated/retail, <=0.70 distressed). Buyer sheet auto-matches the latest `output/buyers_datasift_*.csv` by zip. County card overrides (`--beds/--baths/--sqft/--year-built`) beat Zillow — aggregators get bedroom counts wrong.
- **`comp_analyzer.py`** `fetch_comparable_sales()` now routes through `zillow_market_api` (old endpoint dead); the ARV/adjustment/report engine on top is unchanged.

**Rollout (2026-07-21):** the API pull is the CORE comp-acquisition path across the deal-analysis stack. `deal_analyzer.py` and `main.py comps` already route through the fixed `fetch_comparable_sales`; `real-estate-comping.skill` and `deal-analyzer.plugin` now teach the API-first path (comp-package contract) with manual Zillow/Redfin browsing preserved as the no-key fallback for community users who skip the API. `property_enricher.py` is unaffected (uses the still-live `property-details-address`). Deep-prospecting v4 has no comp surface (heir resolution only). No SiftStack module calls apiv2.reisift.io directly (all CRM writes are Playwright browser automation or Deal Room `_api` scripts, which carry their own Api-Key auth per Ty's directive).

**Dual-track ARV (bedroom-band rule, Ty 2026-07-21):** a subject whose bed count is below the comp set lives in a LOWER value band than per-bedroom adjustments imply (37914 proof: renovated 2-beds capped $215-280K while same-size 3/2s ran $285-385K; a NEW 688sf 3/2 beat the whole 2-bed band at $265K). Base ARV = same-bed renovated comps only, clamped to that band's MEDIAN price (extra sqft cannot escape the band); reconfig-to-more-beds is a labeled UPSIDE track (capped at band p75) credited only after a walkthrough verifies the layout converts. Underwriting (MAO, contract targets) always uses the base track; future-value projections ride the same-bed curve. For stalled/partial renovations, underwrite full gut until walked.

## Dispo Stack (build 1.0.34, 2026-07)

Reusable buyer-finding + dispo-outreach pipeline, generalized from the 158 Old State Rd deal so ANY future property starts with deed-verified buyers and 3-source contact data instead of backfilling. Chain: `buyer_sweep` (who buys here) -> `dispo_skiptrace` (how to reach them) -> `deal_package` (one clean workbook). Runs against the shared Deal Room `_api` SiftMap client + reisift Open API key.

- **`src/buyer_sweep.py`** — SiftMap deed-level buyer sweep for a zip. Pulls the sold universe (Zillow `/search` band pull or a saved `--sold-json`), filters to the investor band (`--min-price/--max-price`, default $25K-$170K, `--months` default 18), then per sale runs SiftMap `autocomplete -> get_detail` for the DEED `sale_history` (buyer_name, is_cash_sale) + `owner_info` (portfolio size/value/equity, mailing). Aggregates + ranks buyers by purchase count, band-fit, portfolio. **Unmasks hidden principals:** when an LLC's mailing address is a residence, it reverse-lookups that address through SiftMap `owner_info` and takes the human owner as the principal (the "Harper move"), falling back to Enformion BusinessV2 officers. Live 2026-07: resolved 175/193 37914 sales -> ranked buyer list; found TN Super Props -> Jonathan Harper, Braden Family -> Joshua Braden by reverse-address. Output `output/buyer_sweep_<zip>_<date>.json|.csv`.
- **`src/dispo_skiptrace.py`** — three-source skip-trace waterfall with a built-in AUDIT MATRIX. Per contact: Source 1 Enformion Person Search (address-anchored via `_best_person` to beat common-name collisions), Source 2 Tracerfy batch ($0.02/rec), Source 3 web people-search cross-check (MANUAL: aggregators bot-block, so it merges a `--web` JSON dropped in by an agent/browser). Dedupes the union, Trestle-scores every unique number, and emits per-number `sources` + `confirm_count` (x2/x3 = cross-confirmed) plus a per-contact audit showing which source MISSED (answers "did we skip-trace this landline at both Tracerfy AND Enformion?"). Dial tiers = phone_validator standard (81-100 first, 61-80 second, 41-60 third, <=40 drop). Input = contacts JSON; output `.json|.csv` with `single_source_flag` + source-gap list.
- **`src/enformion_business.py`** — Enformion **BusinessV2** client (`galaxy-search-type: BusinessV2` on `devapi.enformion.com/BusinessV2Search`, verified live). The v1 `BusinessSearch` type is access-denied and `AddressSearch` is unlicensed on this account. `find_principals(entity, city_state)` returns human officers from `usCorpFilings`/`newBusinessFilings`, filtering out entity self-refs and commercial registered-agent fronts (Northwest Registered Agent, US Corp Agents, etc.).
- **`src/deal_package.py`** — spec-driven 6-sheet workbook generator (the consolidated 158 deliverable, generalized): 1 Deal Summary (numbers to use, value anchors, done-work story, contract gates), 2 Dial Sheet (ranked buyers with PER-BUYER open/target prices), 3 Deal Math (buyer-side + your-side, rehab detail, dual-track ARV), 4 Comps (each with its ROLE in the pitch), 5 Pitch + Sequence (30-sec script, objection answers, day-by-day plan), 6 Sources + Audit. Every section optional on its spec key. DataSift brand styling, zero em/en dashes. `--template` writes `deal_spec_template.json`; `--spec x.json --out "Addr_Deal_Package.xlsx"` renders.

**Feasibility framing (Ty, 158 run):** contract price at/above the as-is band converts a discount-wholesale into a dispo-EXECUTION play: the fee is won on the buyer side, not the buy. GC-model flippers drop out once rehab is heavy (their MAO collapses); the buyer pool becomes SELF-PERFORMERS and landlords, whose MAO/1%-rule math tolerates a higher price. Always verify the seller's real payoff at the Register of Deeds before trusting a stated "what he owes" number, and hold a novation/MLS listing as the backstop (an MLS shell sale is the true market ceiling). Per-buyer ask prices are tuned to each buyer's model (self-performer > landlord > out-of-state), not one blast number.

## Call Coaching Engine (2026-07)

Pulls real call recordings from the SmrtPhone web session, transcribes them with tonality notes, and routes them to three grading skills (`~/.claude/skills/`): **cold-call-coach**, **lead-manager-coach**, **closer-coach**. Each skill grades transcripts against a rubric built from the DataSift Call Playbook KB.

- **`src/call_coaching/pull_calls.py`** - SmrtPhone call log via `POST /logs/calls/filtered` (DataTables form, cookie session from `smrtphone_state.json`). Returns duration, disposition, caller, reisift record link, and a DIRECT recording URL on `rec.smrtphone.io` (public once known, no auth). Filters >= `--min-seconds` (default 60) + has recording; downloads MP3s to `output/call_coaching/recordings/`. Session expired -> exit 2; re-run `_api/smrtphone_login.py` (Deal Room Coaching Call project).
- **`src/call_coaching/transcribe.py`** - two passes per call via OpenRouter Gemini 2.5 Flash (~$0.002/audio-min): (1) audio -> diarized transcript with bracketed delivery notes + DELIVERY SUMMARY (pace/tone/talk balance; the model hears the audio), (2) text -> strict-JSON triage (call_type, pipeline cold_call|lead_management|closing, worth_grading). AGENT/SELLER labels are decided by content with the caller name as anchor (callbacks otherwise swap the labels). Outputs `transcripts/{id}.md|.json` + `review_queue.json` grouped by pipeline.
- **Grading:** Claude (in-session or via Workflow fan-out) scores each `worth_grading` transcript against the skill's `references/rubric.md`, writes per-call reports + per-caller scorecards to `output/call_coaching/reports/{pipeline}/`. Voicemails and wrong numbers are never scored.
- **Rubric sources:** DataSift Call Playbook (Cold Caller / Lead Manager / Closer scripts + trainings), LEAD-M_1.MD, playbook research corpus + elite-call transcripts.

## FTM Foreclosure: multi-pass skip-trace + screenshot-MMS (2026-06; orchestrated from `_api`)

The FTM foreclosure pipeline (consolidate -> single-family filter -> wizard upload -> phone scoring -> cadence) is orchestrated by `_api/ftm_pipeline.py`; these SiftStack scripts are its skip-trace + texting building blocks. Deep detail: the `_api` CLAUDE.md + the `reisift-tagging-and-phone-scoring` / `smrtphone-mms-screenshot-texting` memories.

- **`src/tracerfy_ftm.py`** — Tracerfy re-skip for FTM records (2nd phone source after the free DataSift enrichment). `--all` traces EVERY record (not just no-phone); `--finish` merges found phones into reisift via Add-Data upsert by ADDRESS into the existing "Foreclosure" list. ~$0.02/record.
- **`src/enformion_ftm.py`** — Enformion/Endato 3rd skip-trace pass. Reuses `enformion_heir.person_search` but for the LIVING OWNER (name + property-address anchor; name alone is HTTP-400'd) -> `enf_phones` -> populate `NoticeData.PHONE_FIELDS` -> same merge path. **`clean_owner_name(raw)`** cuts messy co-owner notice strings (AND/&/AKA/C-O markers, Jr/Sr/II-IV suffixes, middle initials, punctuation) to ONE clean (First,Last) so they don't 400. `--addr "<substr,...>"` re-runs specific records; `--finish` merges. **reisift MERGES phones, so Tracerfy + Enformion ACCUMULATE** — run sequentially, then re-score (`_api/score_ftm_phones.py --commit`) + re-tag (`src/run_phone_tag_upload.py --finish`). Live 2026-06-25: 109 -> 302 phones across 33 records, 32/33 with a Dial 1/2. CWD: run `run_phone_tag_upload.py` from the SiftStack root (relative `output/` path).
- **`src/mms_sender.py`** — GATED browser sender for the foreclosure screenshot-MMS (texts each homeowner the auction-notice Dropbox image + a personal message). Built + validated, **PAUSED pre-send (needs Ty's explicit GO).** Drives the **SmrtPhone web app** (SmrtPhone's API can't do MMS): a 2-step send — the TEXT via the new-message "Compose Message" modal, then the IMAGE via the conversation reply box, which lives in the **`main-iframe`** (`page.frame(name="main-iframe")` -> set the screenshot on its hidden `input[type=file]` -> click the send arrow by `bounding_box()` screen position). Reuses `datasift_core` Playwright primitives. Session captured to `smrtphone_state.json` by `_api/smrtphone_login.py`. Recipients/compose/schedule live in `_api` (`build_mms_recipients.py` pulls from the "FTM - 02 Ready to Call" preset). Full mechanism: the `smrtphone-mms-screenshot-texting` memory.

## Apify Deployment

The project runs as an **Apify Actor** in the cloud. When `APIFY_IS_AT_HOME` or `APIFY_TOKEN` is set, `main.py` uses the Actor SDK instead of CLI args.

```bash
# Install Apify CLI
npm install -g apify-cli

# Local test (reads input.json, simulates Actor environment)
apify run --purge

# Deploy to Apify platform
apify login
apify push

# On Apify Console: set up daily schedule and configure secrets in Actor input
```

### Actor Input (configured in Apify Console or `input.json`)
- `mode`: "daily" or "historical"
- `counties` / `types`: arrays to filter saved searches (empty = all)
- `tn_username`, `tn_password`, `captcha_api_key`: secrets (required)
- `google_drive_folder_id`, `google_service_account_key`: optional Google Drive upload

### Actor Output
- **Dataset**: structured records pushed via `Actor.push_data()`
- **Key-value store**: `output.csv` backup
- **Google Drive** (optional): CSV + summary text file uploaded via service account

### Key Files
- `.actor/actor.json` — Actor manifest (name, version, Dockerfile path)
- `.actor/input_schema.json` — Input fields + validation for Apify Console UI
- `Dockerfile` — Based on `apify/actor-python-playwright:3.12`
- `src/drive_uploader.py` — Google Drive upload via base64-encoded service account key
- `input.json` — Local test input (gitignored, contains credentials)

## Courthouse Photo Pipeline (build 1.0.28+)

Courthouse terminal photos → OCR → LLM parse → enrichment → DataSift. Runner takes phone photos at Knox/Blount county terminals, uploads to Dropbox organized as `{county}/{notice_type}/`, system auto-processes.

### Notice Types (7 total)
- `foreclosure`, `tax_sale`, `tax_delinquent`, `probate` — existing from web scraper
- `eviction` — plaintiff = landlord (target contact), defendant = tenant
- `code_violation` — owner of record, violation type, compliance deadline
- `divorce` — petitioner + respondent, property from schedule page

### Critical OCR Patterns (hard-won from live testing)

**Moire pattern from terminal screens is the #1 OCR killer.** Standard Tesseract preprocessing (adaptive threshold, CLAHE) produces garbage on courthouse terminal photos. The fix:
- **Bilateral filter** (`cv2.bilateralFilter(gray, 15, 75, 75)`) removes moire while preserving text edges
- **Otsu threshold** (`cv2.THRESH_BINARY + cv2.THRESH_OTSU`) after bilateral — auto-determines optimal binary threshold
- **PSM 4** (single column variable text) for terminal screens — NOT PSM 6 (single uniform block) which was the research recommendation but fails in practice
- **Do NOT use `fix_rotation()` (Tesseract OSD) on phone photos** — EXIF transpose handles rotation. OSD on raw phone images often fails and the 270° fallback rotates correct images sideways

### Probate Deep Prospecting (from courthouse terminals)

Courthouse probate records have decedent name + PR/executor name but NO property address. Multi-tier lookup fills the gap:

**Property Address Lookup** (Step 3c in enrichment pipeline):
1. **Tier 1: Knox Tax API name search** — search `/parcels/{decedent_name}`, score by token overlap (FIRST MIDDLE LAST → LAST FIRST MIDDLE), accept >= 0.4 match. Tries multiple name variations (with/without suffix, LAST FIRST format, first+last only).
2. **Tier 2: Executor family search** — search Knox Tax API by executor name, look for properties where decedent's last name appears in owner field (family property transferred to executor).
3. **Tier 3: People search** — search TruePeopleSearch/FastPeopleSearch for decedent's last known Knox County address.

**Probate Preset** (obituary enricher):
- Triggers when court record has PR name + decedent name (no address required) — prevents wrong obituary from overriding court-named executor
- Sets DM = the named PR/executor directly, skips obituary search entirely
- Then runs DM address lookup (Knox Tax API → People Search → Tracerfy)

**DOD Sanity Check** (obituary enricher):
- Rejects obituary matches where DOD is > 3 years before the notice **publication** date (`MAX_DOD_GAP_YEARS = 3`)
- Prevents matching a 2014 obituary to a 2025 court filing (wrong person with same name)
- Applied to both full-page and snippet matches
- Anchors on `date_published` (the legal publication date), falling back to `date_added` — NOT `date_added` alone, which is now the run date (see "Date Semantics" under Output)

### Deceased-Owner Heir Resolution — Enformion (opt-in, build 1.0.30+)

The default obituary path extracts survivors/heirs from obituary text with an LLM, which can hallucinate an entire heir map (see `project_obituary_heir_hallucination` memory). The **Primary Path** of the `deep-prospecting` skill replaces this with the Enformion/Endato relatives graph — grounded, nothing inferred.

- **Module:** `src/enformion_heir.py` — reusable client: `person_search()`, `relatives_to_survivors()`, `required_signers()` (cost gate: living closest-kin `relativeLevel == "ab"` + decedent surname + DOB), `dedupe_phones()`, and `resolve_heirs_enformion(notice, parsed)` which returns `(ranked_dms, error_info)` shaped exactly like `build_heir_map()` so the rest of the pipeline is unchanged. Heir signing authority reuses `obituary_enricher.rank_decision_makers` (TN intestacy).
- **Pipeline (Step A only, 1 call/record):** `python src/main.py daily --deep-heirs`. In `obituary_enricher` Phase B, a new **Path E** runs Enformion FIRST for confirmed-deceased owners that no cheaper high-confidence path resolved (surviving co-owner on title, court-named executor). Falls through to the obituary-survivor waterfall on a miss or when creds are absent. Default (no flag, and the Apify daily Actor) keeps the old behavior — Enformion is never auto-billed.
- **Full waterfall (one record):** `python src/run_deep_prospect.py --first X --last Y --street "..." --city Knoxville --state TN --zip 37917` runs Steps A-E (decedent → required signers → per-signer search → phone dedupe → Trestle scoring) and prints a master dial sheet. Consolidates the one-off `run_brice_*` scripts.
- **Creds:** `ENFORMION_AP_NAME` / `ENFORMION_AP_PASSWORD` in `.env` + `config.py`. Billed per match ($0.10/search on the DataSift/affiliate rate the community gets; ~$0.35 public rack); misses are free. Detect API failure by HTTP status, NOT the always-present `error` object.
- **DOD conflict:** Enformion's death-index DOD can disagree with the obituary DOD (often a second household death). Surfaced via a `dod_conflict` flag in `missing_data_flags`; never silently resolved.
- **Live-run gotchas (build 1.0.32, from the 7619 Trey Oaks / James G. Key run):**
  - **Anchor with the full street line on common names.** A name + city/ZIP search returned the WRONG person as `persons[0]` (an Alabama "James B Key"); only `Addresses:[{"AddressLine1":"7619 Trey Oaks Ln","AddressLine2":"Knoxville, TN 37918"}]` pinned the exact record. `enformion_heir.person_search()` currently sends only `AddressLine2` (city/ST/ZIP), so on a common name pass the street line and confirm the match via address history + a cross-referenced relative before trusting `first_match`.
  - **`relativesSummary[].isDeceased` lags and is unreliable** — it showed the decedent, his late wife, and both long-deceased sons as "living." Trust the obituary + the person-level `dod` (the person index had a son's 2014 DOD even though the relatives-summary flag said living).
  - **The relatives graph is capped (~50) and misses married-out daughters** (different surname). Worse, `enformion_heir.required_signers()` gates on a surname match, so it DROPS married-out daughters who are required signers; the skill's shipped `scripts/enformion_person_search.py` correctly gates on `relativeType` (Son/Daughter/Child) and catches them. Always reconcile the signer set against the published obituary's survivor list, not the graph alone.
- **L3 fallback fetcher (Scrapfly ASP, build 1.0.32+):** `src/scrapfly_browser.py` (`ScrapflyBrowserClient.fetch(url)`, plus a `python src/scrapfly_browser.py <url>` CLI) clears Cloudflare/JS walls on county-record + genealogy pages (assessor & deed datalets, FindAGrave, Legacy, court info pages) that plain fetches and sandboxed agent WebFetch fail on. Reuses the `asp=True, render_js=True` core of `scrapfly_client.py` but is URL-generic. `run_deep_prospect.py --fallback-urls "<deed>,<obit>,<docket>"` pulls them inline in the same heir waterfall. **Sweet spot = county/records/genealogy portals** (e.g. recovered deed instrument + joint-owner names when the assessor datalet was blocking plain fetch). **Limits:** hardened people-search aggregators (TruePeopleSearch/FastPeopleSearch) frequently IP-ban ASP (`SHIELD_PROTECTION_FAILED`), and records a county doesn't publish online (Knox TN estate/probate cases, ROD deed images behind a paid subscription) can't be fetched at all (phone/in-person). Residential proxy via `SCRAPFLY_PROXY_POOL` (default `public_residential_pool`). The distributed skill ships a self-contained `scripts/scrapfly_fetch.py` (requests-only, no repo/SDK) for community users.
- **Deliverable = PDF (build 1.0.32+):** deep-prospecting research packs render to a branded PDF via `python src/deep_prospect_pdf.py <pack>.md` (reportlab; no new deps) so they upload cleanly into DataSift/Sift as a record attachment. The renderer keeps the heir map + master dial sheet monospaced and strips em/en dashes + non-WinAnsi glyphs to ASCII.

## DataSift.ai (REISift) Integration

DataSift.ai (formerly REISift) is the CRM where scraped records land for niche sequential marketing campaigns. There is **no REST API** — upload is via Playwright browser automation of the web UI.

**Domain:** `app.reisift.io` (NOT `app.datasift.ai`). API at `apiv2.reisift.io`.

**apiv2 JWT (shared with the Deal Room project):** any script hitting `apiv2.reisift.io` reads the shared auth store at `Deal Room Coaching Call/_api/clients/config/reisift_auth.json` (`datasift-admin` = staff ty+1, ~48h access token; NEVER hardcode a Bearer in SiftStack). Refresh: app.reisift.io DevTools -> Copy as cURL -> `python _api/clients/reisift_auth.py add datasift-admin <jwt>` (run with `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8`; the checkmark-glyph crash after "saved account" is cosmetic, the save succeeded). Then re-impersonate before client-account calls. Last refresh 2026-07-21, exp 2026-07-23 19:41 UTC.

### Key Files
- `src/datasift_formatter.py` — Transforms `NoticeData` → DataSift CSV (42 columns)
- `src/datasift_uploader.py` — Playwright login + upload wizard + enrich + skip trace + preset management + sequence builder + SiftMap sold workflow
- `test_datasift_upload.py` — Headed browser test (upload + enrich + skip trace)
- `test_manage_presets.py` — Headed browser test (preset discovery + sold exclusion + sequence creation)
- `test_manage_sold.py` — Headed browser test (SiftMap sold property tagging)

### CSV Column Structure (42 columns)
- **Core auto-mapped (11):** Property Street/City/State/ZIP, Owner First/Last Name, Mailing Street/City/State/ZIP, Tags
- **Lists + Notes (2):** Lists (for niche sequential), Notes (contextual per notice type)
- **Built-in fields (13):** Estimated Value, MSL Status, Last Sale Date/Price, Equity Percentage, Tax Deliquent Value, Tax Delinquent Year, Tax Auction Date, Foreclosure Date, Probate Open Date, Personal Representative, Parcel ID, Structure Type, Year Built, Living SqFt, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Lot (Acres)
- **Custom fields (16):** Notice Type, County, Date Added, Owner Deceased, Date of Death, Decedent Name, Decision Maker, DM Relationship, DM Confidence, DM 2/3 Name/Relationship, Obituary URL, Source URL, Notice Screenshot

### Niche Sequential Marketing
DataSift's niche sequential system uses filter presets to guide records through SMS → Call → Mail → Deep Prospecting phases. Two preset folders: "00 Niche Sequential Marketing" (12 presets, courthouse data) and "01. Bulk Sequential Marketing" (9 presets, bulk data). All 21 presets exclude Sold status (build 1.0.23). A "Sold Property Cleanup" sequence in the Transactions folder auto-fires on "Sold" tag to change status, remove from lists, clear tasks, and clear assignee.

- **"Courthouse Data" tag:** Every record gets this tag — signals first-to-market county data (prioritized over bulk data in filter presets)
- **Lists column:** Maps `notice_type` → DataSift list name (`foreclosure` → "Foreclosure", `probate` → "Probate", `tax_sale` → "Tax Sale", `tax_delinquent` → "Tax Delinquent", `eviction` → "Eviction", `code_violation` → "Code Violation", `divorce` → "Divorce"). DataSift auto-creates lists from CSV.
- **Tags:** Courthouse Data, notice_type, county, YYYY-MM date, deceased/living, DM confidence level, has_auction, tax_delinquent, photo_import (for photo-sourced records)

### Upload Wizard (5 Steps)
1. **Setup:** Click "Upload File" sidebar → "Add Data" → dropdown "Uploading a new list not in DataSift yet" → enter list name → organization questions
2. **Tags:** Skip through (tags are in CSV column)
3. **Upload File:** Set file on `input[type="file"]`
4. **Map Columns:** Core address fields auto-map; Tags, Lists, and enrichment columns may need manual mapping
5. **Review + Finish Upload:** Click "Finish Upload" — processing happens in background

### Column Mapping Notes
- Only core address fields (Property Street, City, State, ZIP) reliably auto-map
- Tags, Lists, Estimated Value, and enrichment columns often stay unmapped in step 4
- Notes and MSL Status sometimes auto-map
- Custom fields (TN Public Notice group) require drag-and-drop mapping

### Contact Logic
- **Deceased owners:** Contact = decision maker (first/last name + mailing address from DM)
- **Living owners:** Contact = property owner (owner mailing address, falls back to property address)

### Post-Upload: Enrich + Skip Trace

After CSV upload, the pipeline automatically runs two DataSift actions via Playwright:

1. **Enrich Property Information** (Manage → Enrich Data): Adds SiftMap property data (beds, baths, Zestimate, sqft, sale history) to uploaded records. "Enrich Owners" and "Swap Owners" are OFF — protects our PR/DM contact mapping.
2. **Skip Trace** (Send To → Skip Trace): Pulls phone numbers (up to 5 per owner) + emails via unlimited plan ($97/mo). Adds auto-tag `skip_traced_YYYY-MM`.

Both run in background — tracked in Activity tab. Both are ON by default when `--upload-datasift` is set.

### CLI Flags
```bash
python src/main.py daily --upload-datasift        # upload + enrich + skip trace
python src/main.py daily --upload-datasift --no-enrich       # upload only, skip enrichment
python src/main.py daily --upload-datasift --no-skip-trace   # upload + enrich, skip skip trace
python src/main.py daily --notify-slack            # send run summary to Slack/Discord
python src/main.py daily --deep-heirs               # resolve deceased-owner heirs via Enformion ($0.10/match DataSift rate, ~$0.35 rack)
```

### Environment Variables
- `DATASIFT_EMAIL` — DataSift login email
- `DATASIFT_PASSWORD` — DataSift login password
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` — Slack/Discord webhook for run summaries

### Login Selectors (SPA quirks)
- Hidden checkboxes (Remember me, Terms) — click `<label>` elements, not `<input>`
- Use `wait_until="domcontentloaded"` (not `networkidle` — SPA keeps WebSocket connections open)
- Cookie validation: check for `/dashboard` or `/records` in URL (5s wait for SPA redirect)

### DataSift UI Automation Patterns

Hard-won patterns from build 1.0.22-1.0.23 (SiftMap, preset management, sequence builder). Follow these to avoid repeating past mistakes.

**Styled-Components (no native HTML controls)**
- No native `<select>` elements — all dropdowns are `[class*="Selectstyles__Select"]` containers
- `[class*="SelectValue"]` = current value display; `[class*="SelectOptionContainer"]` = dropdown options
- Multiple Select dropdowns exist per panel (Lists, Tags, Property Status) — always target the **LAST visible one**
- Use `x > 450` bounds check in all JS queries to avoid matching sidebar elements (sidebar is 0-400px)
- React state updates require native setter + event dispatch, not just `.value = ...`:
  ```js
  const setter = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(window.HTMLInputElement.prototype, 'value').set;
  setter.call(input, 'new value');
  input.dispatchEvent(new Event('input', {bubbles: true}));
  input.dispatchEvent(new Event('change', {bubbles: true}));
  ```

**Panel Scrolling (Playwright scroll fails)**
- Filter panel is a scrollable `<div>`, NOT the viewport — `scroll_into_view_if_needed()` does nothing
- Use JS: `el.scrollIntoView({behavior: 'instant', block: 'center'})` instead
- Filter Presets section is at the BOTTOM of the filter panel — must scroll container down to reveal
- After scrollIntoView, element y-positions may be negative — don't filter by `y > 0` for the target element

**React DnD (Sequence Builder)**
- Cards have `draggable="false"` — Playwright's native drag won't work
- Must use slow mouse drag: `mouse.move()` → `mouse.down()` → 20 incremental steps (50ms each) → `mouse.up()`
- Add 500ms pauses between down/move/up phases
- "Add new Action +" button required for 2nd+ actions; first action uses initial drop zone
- Sidebar cards can scroll out of view when main area scrolls — scroll BOTH source and target into view before drag

**Pointer Interception (common blockers)**
- Beamer NPS survey iframe (`#npsIframeContainer`) blocks ALL pointer events globally — remove from DOM via `_dismiss_popups()`
- `RecordsFiltersstyles__RecordsFiltersSection` elements intercept clicks — use `page.evaluate()` JS click or `force=True`
- When Playwright click fails with "outside of viewport" or "intercept": switch to `page.evaluate(el => el.click())`
- SiftMap PropertyDetails panel blocks sidebar checkboxes — remove from DOM before interactions

**Preset Management Workflow**
- Flow: open filter panel → scroll to bottom → expand "Filter Presets" → expand folder → click preset → modify → Save (not Save New) → confirm overwrite
- Folder names have case variations ("00 Niche" vs "00 NICHE") — use `.toUpperCase()` comparison
- Preset names follow pattern `^\d{2}\.` (e.g., "00. Needs Skipped")
- 2 folders: "00 Niche Sequential Marketing" (12 presets), "01. Bulk Sequential Marketing" (9 presets)
- All 21 presets have Property Status "Do not include" → "Sold" (build 1.0.23)

**Sequence Builder Workflow**
- Flow: `/sequences` → Create → title + folder → drag trigger → condition → actions tab → drag actions → configure → save
- Duplicate name handling: detect error toast "different sequence title", retry with " V2" suffix
- Actions tab: navigate via "Set the Following Actions" button or URL (`/sequences/new/actions`)
- Autocomplete inputs: after each selection, `fill("")` + Escape to dismiss dropdown before next entry
- "Sold Property Cleanup" sequence exists in Transactions folder (build 1.0.23): Trigger (Property Tags Added) → Condition (Sold) → Actions (Status→Sold, Remove Lists, Clear Tasks, Clear Assignee)

**SiftMap Automation**
- Search by city (NOT county): Knox → "Knoxville, TN", Blount → "Maryville, TN"
- PropertyDetails panel auto-opens on search — remove from DOM before other interactions
- "Add Records to Account" modal: toggle OFF "Do not replace owners", add tags, dismiss dropdown by clicking heading (NOT Escape — clears tags)
- Known limitation: SiftMap filters (price, date) set values visually but don't trigger React re-query. Only sidebar-visible properties (~3-5) get added per run

**Market Finder Extraction Patterns (build 1.0.29+)**

Hard-won patterns from building `extract_market_finder.py`. The Market Finder UI differs significantly from the rest of DataSift.

- **NO HTML `<table>` element** — data table is entirely div-based: `Tablestyles__TableContainer` → `TableRow` → `TableCell` (styled-components). Searching for `<table>` or `<tr>/<td>` finds nothing.
- **PAGINATION, not infinite scroll** — table shows 20 rows per page with "1-20 of N" text and `PaginationInnerContainer` with prev/next `<button>` elements. Must click through ALL pages to get complete data. Knox County has 48 ZIPs (3 pages) and 120+ neighborhoods (7 pages).
- **State/County selection uses `InputMultiSearch`** — NOT styled-component Select dropdowns. Inputs have placeholders: `"Select States"`, `"Select Counties"`, `"Select ZIP Codes"`. Click input → type name → click dropdown result item (`[class*="Item"]:has-text("...")`).
- **ZIP/Neighborhood toggle is a styled Select dropdown** — at the top bar with `Selectstyles__SelectValue` showing current view. Check the displayed text BEFORE clicking — if already on the correct view, clicking toggles AWAY from it. Only click to switch if the displayed text doesn't match the desired view.
- **Beamer push modal (`#beamerPushModal`)** — appears on fresh login, blocks ALL pointer events. Different from the NPS survey (`#npsIframeContainer`). Both must be removed from DOM before any click interactions. Always call dismiss with `force=True` as fallback.
- **Page body scrolling required** — pagination controls are at `y=1867`, below the viewport (`clientH=824`). Must scroll `AdminPage__AdminPageBody` container down before pagination buttons are accessible.
- **Summary panel on right side** — shows county-level aggregates: Median Home Value, Homes on Market, Mo. Investor Transactions, Homes Sold Last Month, Market Rent, Gross Rental Yield, Homeownership Rate. Extract via regex on page text.

```bash
# Extract all Market Finder data for a county
python src/extract_market_finder.py --state "Tennessee" --county "Knox" -v
python src/extract_market_finder.py --state "Tennessee" --county "Knox,Blount" --headless

# Output: JSON file in output/market_finder_{state}_{county}_{timestamp}.json
```

### Key Corrections Made During Optimization (April 2026)
- **Hardcoded credentials removed** from sift-market-research (had email/password in SKILL.md)
- **Bedroom adjustment corrected** from $10K to $5K in real-estate-comping (matched to `comp_analyzer.py`)
- **HML points corrected** from 0% to 2% in deal-analyzer (matched to `deal_analyzer.py DEFAULT_HARD_MONEY_POINTS`)
- **Linux paths fixed** in sequential-presets (was `/home/ubuntu/skills/...`, now relative)
- **Preset names aligned** across 3 skills to match `niche_sequential.py` source code
- **Transfer tax labeled** as Tennessee-specific in deal-analyzer with state reference table for top 10 states
- **"Substantial renovation" defined** in real-estate-comping: kitchen + 1 bath minimum (~$15K spend)
